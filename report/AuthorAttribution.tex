\abstract{
I evaluate a character-level $n$-gram based author attribution method by Peng et al. for attributing anonymous post on Danish Internet forums. I make an analysis of where and in which circumstances Author Attribution can, and cannot be used on the Internet, and which test are relevant to gauge the effectiveness of the Internet based Author Attribution. I show that the the unmodified method cannot be used to identify anonymous posts, and outline my thoughts on both the main problems, and what might be done to improve the method.}
