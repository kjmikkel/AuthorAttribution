\section{Tests}
\label{tests}

In this section I detail the tests, that I will use in order to study the effectiveness of my implementation of the algorithm.

Having attempted by running the tests I sat up in the last section, I will use the same parameters that the authors of \cite{nr4} used, in order to make them comparable. These parameters are: 

\begin{description}
\item[Overall Average] Which is the number of correctly identified authors divided by the number of texts that have had an author identified. E.g. if 8 texts have been identified correctly, and 10 texts have been identified, then the overall average would be 0.8 

\item[Precision] The number of correctly identified texts for an author, divided by the total number of texts that have been identified by that author. E.g. If the author has had 8 texts correctly identified, and 10 texts have been attributed to him, then the Precision would be 0.8. Thus, this is essentially local accuracy.

\item[Recall] Recall is the number of correctly identified texts for an author, divided by the by the number of texts, that have been included in the process, that the author has written.

\item[F-measure] F-measure is a combination of Recall and Precision like so: $\frac{2 \times precision \times recall}{precision+recall}$ 

\item[Macro-average F-measure] The Macro-average F-measure is all the authors F-measures summed together, and then divided by the number of authors. 
\end{description}

\subsection{Key}
Since no test contain every author, I will differentiate author who both appear in the corpora and the test entries, will look thusly: \aAuthor{Axx}, whereas authors who only appear in the corpora will look like so: Axx.

\subsubsection{UltimateStressTest}
A random half of the corpora is checked against the entire corpora \pref{UltimateStressTest}.\\
Due to the size of the table, I have chosen to not represent the table in the manner used in \cite{nr4}, but instead just summing up the recall, precision and hits.\\

\texttt{Ultimate Test 2:}\\\\
\input{tabeller/UltimateTest/UltimateTest2}\\

\clearpage
\texttt{Ultimate Test 3:}\\\\
