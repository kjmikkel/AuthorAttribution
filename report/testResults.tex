\section{Tests}
\label{tests}

In this section present my test results in order to determine the effectiveness of my implementation.

In order to make my test results comparable with \cite{nr4} I will use the same parameters that they used. These parameters are: 

\begin{description}
\item[Overall Average] The number of correctly attributed texts divided by the number of texts that have been attributed. E.g. if 8 texts have been correctly attributed, and 10 texts have been attributed, then the overall average would be 0.8 

\item[Precision] The number of correctly attributed texts for an author, divided by the total number of texts that have been attributed to that author. E.g. if the author has had 8 texts correctly attributed to him, and in total 10 texts have been attributed to him, then the Precision would be 0.8. Thus, this is essentially local accuracy.

\item[Recall] Recall is the number of correctly attributed texts for an author, divided by the by the number of texts that should have been attributed to. E.g. if the authors has had 8 texts correctly attributed to him, but there was 10 texts there was to be attributed - then the recall is 0.8.

\item[F-measure] F-measure is calculated like so: $\frac{2 \times precision \times recall}{precision+recall}$ 

\item[Macro-average F-measure] The Macro-average F-measure is the average of all the authors F-measure. 
\end{description}

\subsection*{Key}
In the following I each author will follow the following format: Axx$^{n}$, where xx is the number identifying the author, and n is the number of posts that the author has written. Furthermore, since no test contain every author, the authors who appear both in the corpora and the texts that are to be attributed will have the following formatting: \aAuthor{Axx$^{n}$}, whereas authors who only appear in the corpora will have no such formatting. All authors who have written only 1 post, will furthermore have the following formatting: \veryFew{Axx$^{n}$}. These formatting may overlap.\\

\subsubsection{UltimateStressTest}
A random half of the corpora is checked against the entire corpora \pref{UltimateStressTest}.\\
Due to the size of the table, I have chosen to not represent the table in the manner used in \cite{nr4}, but instead just summing up the recall, precision, hits, misses (the number texts wrongly attributed the author), the number and percentage of texts attributed to an author with only 1 post.
