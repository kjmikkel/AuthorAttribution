Demands:
Must have a statistic over the frequency of the different n-grams - I have no idea where to et one such, and I do not know if it is suitable to internet forums, where people tend to write different than in real life - use of abbriviations, do not spell check etc.

Pros: 
Seems rather easy to implement - though some more research should be done on ``normalized character bigram frequencies'' and what that means.
