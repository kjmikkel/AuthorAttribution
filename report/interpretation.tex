\section{Interpretation}
I will in this section give my assesment of results presented in the last section. I will do so test by test, before giving a surmation of all the tests.

\subsection{StressTest} 
The test results in the last section clearly shows that all of the strestests fails completely.


\subsection{Ultimate tests}
It is interesting to see that the only real test where the program excells is the ultimate tests, where one might think it would be more likely to fail (since the corpora contains more authors). One explaination might be that since the ultimate tests contain all the post made by an author, and hence more material to compare against, it can be more precise (especially if some of these authors had a more explicit writing style).

\subsection{Conclusion}
From the data found in the different tests, it is clear that the algorithm, or at least the implementation of the algorithm found in \cite{nr4} is not suitable for attributing the authors in a corpora of the used size.
