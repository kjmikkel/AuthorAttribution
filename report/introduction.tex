\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}
Authorship Attribution is the science of attributing the ownership of a text given a list of potential authors. This is done by analysing the the potential authors texts (a so called corpora), and using the gained information to find the most likely author.\\

The most famous case of Author Attribution is the attribution of 12 essays written in the \q{The Federalist Papers} series, whom both Alexander Hamilton and James Madison claimed to have written. Most modern Authorship Analysis believes that James Madison wrote them \cite{Fung03thedisputed}\fixme{Tentive: Is this good enough?}.\\
 The introduction of computers, and the Internet, where texts are published anonymously, has increased the importance of Author Attribution \fixme{Why? say something about plagiarism and crimes}. I will in this paper try to apply an already developed Author Attribution technique to posts found on Internet forums, and try to evaluate the quality of the result.\\

Internet forums are interesting to study, \fixme{Should this have its own section?} the posts that comprise them are short, informal, and full of bad spelling and grammar\footnote{One would also be remiss to forget the many strange abbreviations, and features unique to the Internet (such as hyperlinks or embedded pictures)}, unlike the works of famous authors (who tends to be used in the studies \cite{nr4}). 

\subsection{Scope and Limitations}
\label{scope}
A common feature in papers about Authorship Attribution is that their sample languages tend to be English, Greek and Chinese \cite{syntactic}, \cite{nr2}, \cite{nr4} and \cite{app-spe}. Since I do not have any relation to any Greek or Chinese forum, and indeed no ability to speak or understand either language, I have chosen to exclusively concentrate on forums and methods that works on a character based language.

\subsection{Expectations to the reader}
\label{expectations}
I expect the reader to be familiar with the problems within the field Author Attribution, as well as a theoretical, and practical experience - especially the n-gram method and theoretical and practical experience with statistical methods. Due to the nature of the sample content, it would be advisable if the reader has a familiarity with low-brow Internet forums, and the kind of posts made on these. Sites such as Slashdot.org or a console gaming forum would be preferable.

\subsection{Learning targets and objectives}
\label{learning}
\subsubsection{Learning targets}
After having completed this assignment I will have learned 
\begin{itemize}
\item To briefly be able to summarise techniques, practical as well as theoretical, for authorship attribution.
\item Apply a simple technique for authorship attribution on a limited and specific domain with texts, which have special syntactical characteristics.
\item To be able to implement and test the above in a practical manner.
\item To be able to properly interpret these test results
\end{itemize}
