\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}
Authorship Attribution is the science of assigning ownership of a disputed or anonymous text, given a list of potential authors. A relevant subset of these authors texts, a so-called corpora, is analysed, and the gained information is then used to find the most likely author of the disputed text.\\

The most famous case of Author Attribution is the attribution of 12 essays written in the ``The Federalist Papers'' series, whom both Alexander Hamilton and James Madison claimed to have written. Many modern works on Authorship Analysis attribute these works to James Madison \cite{Fung03thedisputed}.\\
 The introduction of computers and the Internet, where texts can be published anonymously, has increased the importance of Author Attribution, as it is now easier than ever before to commit plagiarism or illegal sharing of texts - for example selling school reports on the Internet. Authorship Attribution might also be used for Internet forums and message boards, where it can identify the real author of possible ``sock puppets'' \footnote{i.e. posts written by authors who create a false persona on the forum to either backup their own opinions or oppose others}.\\ 

I will in this report try to apply an already developed Author Attribution technique to posts found on a Internet forum, and try to evaluate the quality of the technique.\\

Internet forums are interesting to study, since the posts that comprise them are short, informal, and full of bad spelling and grammar\footnote{Not to mention the many strange abbreviations (``lol'', ``btw''), and features unique to the Internet (such as hyperlinks and embedded videos and pictures)}. All of this quite unlike the works of famous authors (who tend to be used in the studies \cite{nr4}). 

\subsection{Applications}
When attempting to apply Authorship Attribution techniques to the Internet, it is important to consider in which contexts it is applicable. Ideally, we should be able to use Authorship Attribution on all text on the Internet, and thus be able to figure out the identify of an anonymous poster, presumed ``sock puppet'' or previously banned user. However, there are some fundamental problems that prohibits this ideal from being reality:

\begin{description}
\item[Comments:] In services with comment features (such as blogs, on-line newspaper or video streaming services) there may be problems with the sparseness of the data. Depending on how debate-able the topic is, most people will only post a few comments pr. item - but if the item is popular, then this might be done by many authors, which in the end creates a lot of posts. This means that for any given time block, there will be a large author to post ratio (i.e. close to 1), which necessitates that the comments for many items/threads would have to be collected in order to assemble a decent corpora from an author. Forums and message boards does not suffer from this to the same degree, as almost all threads are created to start a debate. Forums and message boards also tends to have a greater social dimension.

\item[Wikis:] One of the problems that wikis face is vandalism, either in the form of erroneous material, or outright defacement of its pages - an Author Attribution system could be seen as a help, as malicious users could be banned before they acted on their impulses. In practice, however, the following problems makes it practically infeasible:
\begin{description}
\item[Vandals:] Since an account handle is cheap (or perhaps not even needed), the vandal can just register for a new one, and then vandalise, delete and deface pages she/he wants to. Since most wiki software allows the pages to be restored in a few clicks, and has provisions to ban the IP-address\footnote{Which acts as a far better identifier than an on-line handle} from which the changes took place - Author Attribution seem like an expensive approach.  

\item[Editing problem:] Another problem that might occur when trying to make Author Attribution on a wiki, is that, while some people who will write long, connected, passage of texts\footnote{For instance the creator/main contributor of the article}, many other edits are minor changes that occur inside already existing passages - and therefore not representative for the authors corpora profile.   
\end{description} 
\end{description}

On these grounds I therefore think that forums and message boards are both the most feasible and  interesting on-line systems to apply Author Attribution to.

\subsection{Scope and Limitations}
\label{scope}
A common feature in papers about Authorship Attribution is that their sample languages tend to be English, Greek and Chinese \cite{syntactic}, \cite{nr2}, \cite{nr4} and \cite{app-spe}. Since I do not have any relation to any Greek or Chinese forum, and do not understand either language, I have chosen to concentrate exclusively on forums and methods that works on a character based language\footnote{Compared to the pictogram based alphabets, such as Chinese} - more specifically Danish.

\subsection{Expectations to the reader}
\label{expectations}
I expect the reader to be familiar with the field of Authorship Attribution, as well as having a theoretical and practical experience with applying Authorship Attribution techniques - especially the n-gram and statistical methods. Due to the nature of the sample content, it would be advisable if the reader has a familiarity with a cross section of relaxed non-formal Internet forums, and the kind of posts made on these. Sites such as slashdot.org or a console gaming forum would be preferable.

\subsection{Learning targets and objectives}
\label{learning}
\subsubsection{Learning targets}
After having completed this assignment I will have learned 
\begin{itemize}
\item To briefly be able to summarise techniques, practical as well as theoretical, for Authorship Attribution.
\item Apply a simple technique for Authorship Attribution on a limited and specific domain with texts, which have special syntactical characteristics.
\item To be able to implement and test the above in a practical manner.
\item To be able to properly interpret these test results
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Terminology}
In this report I will use the words ``post'' and ``text'' interchangeably\footnote{Since each post is self-contained, I think it is valid to identify it as a short text}, and likewise with the words ``forum'' and ``message-board'', as there in this case is no practical distinction.
