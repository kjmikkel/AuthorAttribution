ngram specification:
* Should be able to give me an arbitery number of chars
* I should be able to build up a database of the information
* There should be some way of linking the result and the information I get out of it
* I need the amount of times the n-gram appers in the text
* I need a way to handle sparse data sets - though this should not really be a problem for small n (if the alphabet is larger than 1000 there might be however)
* I should be able to extract the information easily
* There should not be one centralized 
* There should be some preprocessing to changethings that will always differ from text to text - such as numbers - in this instane all numbers should be changed into a symbol or escape character that does not otherwise appear in any text - look into this
* One should be able to attribute several texts to the same author (database question)
* One should be able to do all the calculations, andt then extract all the informatoin from the database from that perticular instance, and then run the analysis through the function that way I would be able to add new tests, and I would also be able to
